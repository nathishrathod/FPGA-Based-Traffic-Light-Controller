# 🚦 FPGA-Based Traffic Light Controller with Priority System

## Overview
Verilog-based 2-way traffic light controller (North–South and East–West) with **emergency vehicle priority override**.  
Designed for FPGA implementation (e.g., Xilinx Spartan) and fully simulated online using **EDA Playground / Vivado**.  
This repository contains the Verilog design, testbench, and waveform output demonstrating the system’s behavior.

## 🧩 Files Included
- `traffic_controller.v` — Main Verilog RTL Design  
- `tb_traffic.v` — Testbench (stimulus and waveform generation)  
- `waveform.png` — Screenshot of simulation waveform  
- `README.md` — Project documentation (this file)

---

## 📊 Simulation Waveform

The waveform below demonstrates:
- Normal operation cycle (NS Green → NS Yellow → All-Red → EW Green → EW Yellow → All-Red → repeat)
- Priority override for emergency vehicles (`emg_ns` or `emg_ew`) that immediately grants a Green signal to that direction

**Waveform Output:**

## 🧠 Implementation Steps

1. **Open EDA Playground** → select Verilog/SystemVerilog + EPWave.
2. Copy and paste:
   - `traffic_controller.v` (design)
   - `tb_traffic.v` (testbench)
3. Click **Run** → Open **EPWave** to view the waveform.
4. Capture waveform screenshot (`waveform.png`).
5. Upload all files to your GitHub repository:
